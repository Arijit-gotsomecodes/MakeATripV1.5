# Setting Up the App

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Hotel Booking App on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Node.js installed on your system.

## Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisblakely01/mern-booking-app.git
cd mern-booking-app
```

## Backend Configuration

1. **Environment Files**: Navigate to the `backend` folder and create two files: `.env` and `.env.e2e`. Add the following contents to both files:

    ```plaintext
    MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=

    JWT_SECRET_KEY=
    FRONTEND_URL=

    # Cloudinary Variables
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

    # Stripe
    STRIPE_API_KEY=
    ```

2. **MongoDB Setup**: 
    - Sign up for an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
    - Create a new cluster and follow the instructions to set up a new database.
    - Once set up, obtain your MongoDB connection string and add it to the `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` variable in your `.env` files.

3. **Cloudinary Setup**:
    - Create an account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
    - Navigate to your dashboard to find your cloud name, API key, and API secret.
    - Add these details to the respective `CLOUDINARY_*` variables in your `.env` files.

4. **Stripe Setup**:
    - Sign up for a Stripe account at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
    - Find your API keys in the Stripe dashboard.
    - Add your Stripe API key to the `STRIPE_API_KEY` variable in your `.env` files.
  
5. **JWT_SECRET_KEY**:
    - This just needs to be any long, random string.

7. **Frontend URL**:
    - The `FRONTEND_URL` should point to the URL where your frontend application is running (typically `http://localhost:3000` if you're running it locally).
  

## Frontend Configuration

1. **Environment Files**: Navigate to the `frontend` folder and create a file: `.env`:

    ```plaintext
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=
    VITE_STRIPE_PUB_KEY=
    ```

5. **VITE_API_BASE_URLL**:
    - The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should point to the URL where your backend application is running (typically `http://localhost:7000` if you're running it locally).

## Running the Application

1. **Backend**:
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
    - Start the server: `npm start`.

2. **Frontend**:
    - Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
    - Start the frontend application: `npm run dev`.
    - The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` but verify this in your command line terminal
